# FlixGo - Netflix-Inspired Streaming Platform

FlixGo is a modern, responsive streaming platform inspired by Netflix. It features a sleek UI/UX with dynamic content sections, smooth transitions, an interactive 3D poster wall on the homepage, lazy loading, and subtle animations for an engaging user experience.

This repository contains the **client-side** (frontend) of the project, currently built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Future plans include migrating to React.js for better modularity and state management.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout** – Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Hero Carousel** – Full-width featured content slider.
- **Dynamic Content Rows** – Scrollable rows for different categories (e.g., Trending, New Releases, etc.).
- **3D Poster Wall** – Eye-catching homepage section with mouse-controlled 3D rotation and tilt effects (lightweight implementation for performance).
- **Lazy Loading** – Images load as users scroll to improve initial load time.
- **Smooth Animations & Transitions** – Subtle hover effects, fade-ins, and parallax-like scrolling.
- **Dark Theme** – Netflix-style dark UI for comfortable viewing.
